# ACOM Controller

Minimalistic Windows application for controlling and monitoring an *ACOM 600S*, 
*ACOM 700S*, and *ACOM 1200S* shortwave radio power amplifier from the PC desktop
via its RS-232 control interface. 

With the help of a ethernet serial port server or a remote serial port application 
like `com2tcp` it can also be used for remote operation. 

Designed for a minimal screen footprint and can be modified to consume even less. 

Default configuration is for ACOM 600S with communication on COM4. 

Right-click the *Standby* button to access the configuration panel.
