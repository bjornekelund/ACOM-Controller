Minimalistic WPF application for controlling an ACOM 600S from the 
PC desktop via its RS-232 remote control interface. 

Consumes very little screen real estate and easily be 
modified to consume even less. Also easily modifiable for 
e.g. ACOM 1200S or the upcoming ACOM 700S. 

Connects to COM4 by default but adding the name of a different COM 
port on the command line will make it connect to this instead, 
e.g. "ACOMController COM5". If you are using scripted start-up of 
apps, like DXLab Launcher, that does not allow command line arguments, 
this is not a problem. 
ACOM Controller will remember the used COM port between sessions so 
you only need to execute the app once with a command line argument 
to set the COM port. This can be done from e.g. the Windows Command 
window or Power Shell.
