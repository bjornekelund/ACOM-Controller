# ACOM Controller

Minimalistic Windows application for controlling and monitoring *ACOM 600S*, 
*ACOM 700S*, and *ACOM 1200S* shortwave radio power amplifiers from the desktop
via its RS-232 remote control interface. 

With the help of an ethernet serial port client and server or a serial port 
tunneling application like `com2tcp` it can also be used for geographically 
remote operation. 

Right-click the *Standby* button to access the configuration panel.
Default configuration is for ACOM 600S with communication on COM4. 

Can optionally always stay on top of other apps to e.g. allow use with a full screen logger on a single screen.
