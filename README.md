# ACOM Controller

Minimalistic Windows application for controlling and monitoring an *ACOM 600S*, 
*ACOM 700S*, and *ACOM 1200S* shortwave radio power amplifier from the PC desktop
via its RS-232 control interface. Using a remote serial port application like 
`com2tcp` it can be used for remote operation also. 

Designed for a minimal screen footprint and can be modified to consume even less. 

Default configuration is for ACOM 600S with communication on COM4. 

Access to the configuration is through right-clicking the on/off button.
