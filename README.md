# ACOM Controller

Minimalistic Windows application for controlling and monitoring *ACOM 500S*, *ACOM 600S*, 
*ACOM 700S*, *ACOM 1200S*, and *ACOM 2020S* shortwave radio power amplifiers from the 
desktop via its RS-232 remote control interface. 

With the help of an ethernet serial port client and server or a serial port tunneling 
application like `com2tcp` it can also be used for geographically remote operation. 

Right-click the *Standby* button to access the configuration panel.
Default configuration is for ACOM 700S with communication on COM1. 

Can optionally always stay on top of other apps to e.g. allow use with a full 
screen logger on a single screen.

The "Do nothing if already running" option silently stops the program at 
start up if another copy is already running.
